                Pal became very popular and are commonly used in school farewells. His popular songs included "Tadap
                Tadap Ke Is Dil Se" from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999), the Tamil song "Apadi Podu", "Dola Re Dola" from

                festival at Nazrul Mancha
                auditorium, in South Kolkata.[39] After the concert, he returned to his hotel in Esplanade. He
                complained of feeling unwell soon after his performance on the way back to his hotel, where he had a
                cardiac arrest. He collapsed, and efforts to revive him at the hotel were unsuccessful.[40] He was
                rushed to Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) at around 10:30 pm, where he was declared
                dead.[41][42] He was 53 years old at the time of his death.</p>
